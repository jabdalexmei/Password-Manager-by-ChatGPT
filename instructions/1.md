**Fix spec (EN)**

- **Goal:** Folder deletion must clean up attachments consistently.
    
- **Files:**
    
    - `src-tauri/src/services/folders_service.rs`
        
    - `src-tauri/src/services/datacards_service.rs` (reuse existing logic)
        
- **Required change:**
    
    - For `delete_folder_and_cards`:
        
        - If `soft_delete_enabled == true`: for each datacard in folder, also call `repo_impl::soft_delete_attachments_by_datacard(...)` (and keep files for possible restore).
            
        - If `soft_delete_enabled == false`: before `purge_datacards_in_folder`, enumerate all datacards + attachments in that folder and remove files from `attachment_file_path(...)` similarly to `purge_datacard_with_attachments`.
            
- **Acceptance criteria:**
    
    - After hard-deleting a folder, no orphan attachment files remain on disk.
        
    - After soft-deleting a folder, deleted cards and their attachments are consistently marked deleted and restorable.
